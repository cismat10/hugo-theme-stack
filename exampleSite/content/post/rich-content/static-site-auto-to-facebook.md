\## Identify The Topic

In this step, choose a topic, it can either be one you already familiar with or a topic you need to study now. Read a subtopic on few paragraphes and write down what you have understood from that session in your own words.

NB: in this step (the first step) *when you are reading, understanding and putting down your own notes your are **you are using the Left part of your Brain**

\## Put It In Plain Language

After you are done with the first step, open a plank canvas "*Obsidian for instance*" and put down what you have studied in a plain english/language for that matter. And when i say in plain language, i mean that simplified and clear langugae whereby anyone can understand even if its a five year old child.

NB: in this step (the second step). *when you open a plank canvas and start putting down what you have studied in plain language * **you are using the both hemispheres of your Brain "the left side which is the LOGIC  and the write side which is the CREATIVE one"

\## Fill In The Gaps

when putting down notes or simply explaining a topic to someone you will come across areas where you have not understood well enough. For this instance, go back to source material (the source material can be a lecture, videobook, audiobook or texbook) and fill in the gaps you have grasped well enough

\## Review And Simplify ( Optional)

Strive to simplify your work as much as possible and try to explain the areas you have assumed along the way. Make sure to use simple language so that someone who has no idea about the topic can be able to understand.

ask yourself a question, Can a five year Old understand this? if NO, then go back to source material and redo the steps above.
